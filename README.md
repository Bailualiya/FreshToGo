Mobile E-Commerce Platform
Project Description
This project is a mobile e-commerce platform developed using Android Studio with Java to deliver a seamless native Android shopping experience. The app enables users to browse grocery products, manage shopping carts, securely process payments, and track deliveries in real-time via the Google Maps API.

We translated both low-fidelity and high-fidelity wireframes created in Figma into fully responsive and accessible user interfaces following Material Design principles, ensuring an intuitive experience across different devices.

To ensure reliable backend communication, we integrated and thoroughly tested RESTful APIs using Postman, simulating real-world edge cases such as payment failures and delivery delays. This helped maintain data consistency and improve error handling.

On the performance front, we utilized Android Studioâ€™s profiling tools to analyze UI layouts, memory usage, and network requests. This process identified performance bottlenecks, allowing us to optimize app responsiveness and loading times effectively.

This project demonstrates expertise in:

Mobile development: Native Android app development with Java and Android Studio

UI/UX design: Implementing responsive UIs with Material Design based on Figma wireframes

API integration and testing: Consuming RESTful services and validating with Postman

Performance optimization: Profiling and enhancing memory, UI, and network efficiency

Problem solving: Handling edge cases such as payment errors and delivery timeouts

Future plans include adding personalized recommendations, expanding payment options, and implementing push notifications to enhance user engagement.
